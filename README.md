# Planetary - ShareX server


### TODO:
- Albums. There's some snippets of it in the codebase already, al though it doesn't work yet.
- Admin panel
- Profile settings page
- Clean up the sometimes absolutely horrible to read code
- Improve SSE


## Setup:
- `mkdir planetary && cd planetary`
- `git clone https://github.com/LoiLock/Planetary.git .` - Clone repository
- `npm i` - Install dependencies
- `node setup.js` - Simple setup wizard
- `npm start` - Start it
The first user will also have admin rights
